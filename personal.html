		<h4 class="fade-up show-up">About me</h4>
		<p class="fade-up show-up">My name is Miodrag Vukovic, i was born on July 17th 1987 in Nis, Serbia. Talking about yourself isn't an easy task, at least not for me, but these are some random things i'd like to share.</p>
		<p class="fade-up show-up">I like to believe im a free spirit, a simple guy with simple life, spicing it up a bit to make it an enjoyable ride.</p>

		<p class="fade-up show-up">Ever since i can remember i was attracted to sports, all kinds of sports, as i grew older the appetite for trying out all types of activities (especially extreme ones) grew as well. Therefore, skating, rollerblading, mountainbiking, skiing, snowboarding, bicycling are part of me growing up ( my inner child still forces me to do those ).</p>

		<p class="fade-up show-up">As for school, well i can freely say i went trough school like a hot knife through butter, not in a good way, i wasn't really interested in social subjects, memorizing dozens of pages just so you can pass a test isn't my thing. On the other hand formal subjects such as math and physics caught my attention cause they required a bit deeper understanding of logic behind them. So when they sum it up, do the math, i was pretty average student.</p>

		<p class="fade-up show-up">As i started living alone quite young, right after high school, i had to take reason and responsibilites quite serious, take care of my own problems. Figured that people worth as much as they are ready to give away.</p>

		<p class="fade-up count">Rock music is the right choice!</p>

		<p class="fade-up count">I like machines, i mean, i really really like machines. They are mechanical beasts which should be treated with respect, maintained and used with caution. So naturally, im into mechanics, assembling and disassembling engines is a small hobby of mine and also a thing that refreshes my mind and gives it a temporary sanctuary.</p>

		<p class="fade-up count">We're living fast life's on a fast spinning ball, a week goes by in a blink of an eye, a month as well and the time we get to spend the way we want it, the real life, is precious. Some people go clubbing, others choose fishing or whatever, im a guy who gear up, play some fine rock music on headphones, put on the helmet, start up my motorcycle, either a chill ride or highest peak of a mountain, riding make past and future completely disappear, life becomes all about the present moment and the feeling you have. Thats how i "charge my batteries".</p>

		<p class="fade-up count">Did i forget to mention beer? Ye, i LOVE beer!</p>
